# Resume Builder

A small application where users can input their information and generate a CV/résumé.

## Challenges Encountered

**Showing and hiding each section of the sideba**: At first, I tried to use the "select"element to display the form controls of each section similar to a dropdown menu. After trying, i realized that a simple button sufficed.

**Adding more content to the "Experience" and "Education" section**: The instructions of the project don't specify that for these sections, the user must can add as many items as possible. But because my goal was to finish this project by the end of the summer, I realized that I won't be able to, because it was taking me too much time. So, what I ended up doing was follow the project's instructions.
